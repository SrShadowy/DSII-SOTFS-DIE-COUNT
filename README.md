## 💻 Requirements 📝
It's necessary to have [".net 6"](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed on the machine

## 📝 But how is this actually working? 🤔🤔

It's working on DARK SOULS™ II Scholar of the First Sin Steam Version, [check he here](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/335300/).

In current version 1.03, Calibrations 2.02.
Using the Windows API, ReadProcessMemory, I can access the dots that indicate the kill count of your saved game.



## 🚫 I can BAN with that? 🤔🤔

I don't think so, it's very unlikely in reality, but since it's unauthorized software, it might be able to.
Although there are no memory writes or modifications, they are extremely similar to speed runs software for example.

## 💻 I can use in FullWindow? 🤔🤔

Currently it is not an external overlay so it is another window that is superimposed on the game, but even if it is visible, you can still play the game without losing focus on the game window, either on the keyboard and mouse or on the gamepad control.
## ✌️ Lets Show 😊

Here is the big mod

I manually supported most resolutions up to fullHD.
But unfortunately it will only work in windowed mode;


## Problems?


### 🤷‍♂️ "OMG!!!I PRESS ALT+TAB BUT THE OVERLAY DOESN'T DISAPPEAR"🤦‍♀️

Calm down, to hide and show,  just press the Home key on your keyboard 😊

The same in Game.


### 🤦‍♂️ "I open but does show anything" 🤷‍♀️

come on, that could be many things.

Your game needs to be open, and loaded in your save, otherwise it may not appear.

Another thing, it may be the game version, a different version may cause incompatibilities and it may not find the points in the memory to read your death counts

By the way, just open your system's Task Manager, look for DS2_DEATH_COUNT and close it.
